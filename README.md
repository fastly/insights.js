## FAQ

### What is it?
Fastly Insights is an optional service deployed by some Fastly customers for network and performance monitoring and research purposes. It does not collect any personal data. We are only interested in your network, to make the internet work better.

The JavaScript library is built using the [Open Insights][open-insights] framework. We collect information about HTTP and HTTPS network transactions, including: network routing, performance timing, and equipment characteristics. Measurements are recorded to analyze the performance of the Fastly network and overall state of the internet. 

Insights.js is served via Fastly’s CDN. All collected data is sent back to the Fastly Insights service and log streamed using Fastly’s [log streaming](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/streaming-logs/) to a Fastly managed data warehouse for subsequent analysis. 

### How does it work?
The library is deployed to websites via a JavaScript `<script>` tag, such as: 

```html
<script defer src="https://www.fastly-insights.com/insights.js?k=1111-2222-3333"></script>  
```

In the above tag, `k` is an API token that identifies the host website to Fastly. The script contains code to load and execute a minimal task runner application. All tasks are run as low-priority requests and are designed not to interfere with the user's current page navigation or alter the host page’s [Document Object Model (DOM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) in any way, to prevent it from accessing first-party data on the page or affecting page load performance. 

Each task fetches one or more objects from the network and gathers timing information associated with the request (using the [ResourceTiming API](https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/)) and any other browser information required by the task. See [below](#what-type-of-information-does-fastly-insights-collect) for the full list of task types.

The results of each task are normalized (such as IP anonymization, see [full list of task types](#what-type-of-information-does-fastly-insights-collect) for further information regarding normalization) and the data is then beaconed back to the Fastly Insights service via a POST request to fastly-insights.com/beacon.

The service then adds additional data available from Fastly’s [standard logging variables](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/streaming-logs/useful-variables-to-log) related to the network request and logs all final data to a Fastly managed data warehouse.

### Request flow
![Request flow](https://insights.fastlylabs.com/static/media/request-flow.4b4fe6cf.png)

1. Page load.
1. Fetches configuration from Fastly Insights service.
1. Tasks are executed (see also: [full list of task types](#what-type-of-information-does-fastly-insights-collect) and data collected):
    1. Network requests made to test objects.
    1. Task information recorded on the client.
1. Task information is beaconed back to the Fastly Insights service.
1. Additional information is recorded at the Fastly Insights service before ingestion.
1. Information collected in step 3 and 5 is logged to a Fastly managed data warehouse for post-processing.

### What type of information does Fastly Insights collect?
The following table lists each of the possible tasks Fastly Insights may run on a host web page:
